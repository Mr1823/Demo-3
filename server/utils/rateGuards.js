 * real value — and checkout priced and charged against it for weeks. These
 * guards exist so that specific mistake cannot repeat silently. They are
 * deliberately wide: the job is to catch an order-of-magnitude slip (a missing
 * digit, a paise/rupee mix-up), not to track the market.
 *
 * Single source of truth — the zod schema, the admin form and the dashboard
